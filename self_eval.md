# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
At first i struggled trying to find the difference between arrays and hashes, but after
working with them for a little bit, I can see how each could be useful
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
initially, i had trouble taking notes that included code, but after some time i got used it it.
It is just useful to reiterate, and go over material again by writing it down.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I only use google as a last resort, i try to solve the problem in my code first and foremost.
